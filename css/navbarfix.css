/* Created by Sahil Awan - 230073302.

This is a fix for an error that is affecting some pages but not all.
The navbar on some pages require a little shift from the right-hand side to allow the
basket icon to be fully visible. 

This fix has been applied to only a few pages, including all html pages in the categories section,
contact, aboutus, checkout and basket pages. */
